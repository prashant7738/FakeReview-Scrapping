"Overall, this laptop stand does the job, but there’s definitely room for improvement. The hinges are a bit too loose, which affects the stability but after placing laptop  it doesn't slips out of position. 

The rubber tape is  attached but not good  as advertised . I think it will be gonna deatached out soon

If the hinges were tighter, this would easily be a 5-star product.",23 Apr 2025,4.0

"For the price, this laptop stand is decent but has some drawbacks. While functional, it’s not the most durable option. The paint tends to chip off easily, and the rubber pads on the feet wore out fairly quickly. 
I'd recommend setting it up in a fixed spot rather than moving it frequently to prolong its lifespan.",12 Nov 2024,3.0
"working fine. But I don't suggest to buy if your laptop is heavier than 1.5KG or bigger in size than 13 inch. it's good for MacBook and similar laptops. you cant move it from one to another position normally, if you do so your stand might get broken or your laptop may get damaged. so if you can fix your laptop in one place and your table is placed in the corner of your room then you can be benefited by this product otherwise don't buy it. 
 ",29 Mar 2025,3.0
"Overall build quality is nice for the price. My only gripe is the slider feet which is inserted in one of the 7 holes is made of plastic. Making it as critical point of failure. As the whole laptop weight stands on it, there is high to medium change of breakage within a year. Rest of the build is aluminum and decently sturdy. A good product nonetheless if you intend to use for a year or two at decentish price.

"Got the product delivered, the next day. 
The material looks good, can also be used for heavy gaming laptops. 
While other things look good, the hinges are kinda loose, not a perfect fit, which reduces the overall usage experience... thus only 3 stars...
if you are using an external keyboard for typing the stand seems to be good enough... which I am doing",20 Feb 2022,3.0
"Great product, sturdy and firm. Gets the job done, when at the steepest angle. Make sure to keep the legs flat on the surface to reduce/eliminate wobbling. I recommend using external mouse & keyboard when using a lepton with this. Lastly, done good words for the vendor who tried to give me personalised customer service. Thanks a lot! ",09 Aug 2021,5.0
Not worth the price. It has strength to support the laptop but it is not suitable for laptops larger than 15.6 inch because it is too narrow. Also one of the bars don't align properly in the holes :/ Absolutely not worth RS 1000. It would be a great product it if was around 300 rupees.,26 Jan 2022,3.0

Its good and sturdy....except one leg is a bit loose than the other. Doesn't seem like a problem though,11 Oct 2022,5.0
"Bought it about 2 weeks ago and have been using it for a while. While most of the reviews here found it good, I didn't. For me, the product felt not well-engineered. The axes of the hinges are not sturdy and the handles kept slipping from their holes whenever I had to do micro-adjustments to the laptop. Don't get me wrong -- the stand handles any weight of the laptop because it's made from metal and can give the keyboard a much needed slope to make it easy to write. But the lack of sturdyness of the stand and the small width of the stand make typing hard because the laptop felt wobbly. If you are going to attach an external keyboard, then this product might be a good buy as you won't be touching a laptop. But, if you are going to be typing on the laptop then you are going to not like it.

PS: My laptop is a 15.6 inch laptop and I bought this laptop mainly so that the keyboard will feel inclined and the sharp edges of the laptop wont hurt my hand.",29 Nov 2021,1.0

"I guess you get what you paid for. The product is okay and it is holding my 16inch macbook properly.
One of the stand is very lose, so it's a bit hard to setup because of it. I don't think it'll give any issues if I don't move it too much, but will have to wait to find that out.",15 Nov 2022,4.0
Surprisingly heavier that expected but the locks are quite sturdy so till now no issue. The aluminium alloy is heavier that other laptop stand i have used.,25 Oct 2021,5.0
"Gets the job done!

It isn't real aluminium by any chance, feels more like a plastic with aluminium looking coat.
But hey I am not an industrial scientist.

Doesn't feel durable if thrown around but supports my 13"" MacBook pro.
It is slightly wobbly at times and even when fully expanded horizontally it's only 5"" long which feels a little short for my 13"" mac.
Wouldn't recommend for bigger or sturdier laptops.

What can I say, there's room for improvement in the product. The idea is great. The implementation is subpar.
I had higher expectations with the product so keep yours low.

The rubber grips are fairly good though!",29 Jan 2022,3.0
"good product but right side leg is bit uneven and doesn't snugly fit inside the notched groove(pwal). it tends to wobble, but with the load of laptop, the wobbling issue is eliminated.",30 Jan 2023,5.0
